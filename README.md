- **Shopping Cart**: Add, view, and manage items in the user's cart.
- **Order Processing**: Place and view orders.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Restricted functionalities for managing the store's data and settings.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot 6**
- **AWS MySQL** - Relational database for data storage
- **Spring Security** - For authentication and authorization
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** - Secure token-based authentication
- **Maven** - For dependency management and build automation
